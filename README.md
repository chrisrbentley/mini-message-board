# Mini Message Board

## Overview

Welcome to the **Mini Message Board App**! This is a simple web application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **PugJS**. It serves as a basic message board where users can post messages and view messages posted by others. This project was developed as a learning exercise, marking the developer's first venture into building a real application with Node.js and Express, while also incorporating MongoDB for data storage. The application adheres to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern.

## Features

- **Message Posting:** Users can post messages to the message board, sharing their thoughts, ideas, or questions with the community.

- **Message Viewing:** Visitors can view all the messages posted by different users on the message board.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The application is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows server-side scripting and building network applications.

- **Express:** Express is used as the web application framework to handle routing, middleware, and other web-related functionality.

- **MongoDB:** MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is utilized to store the messages posted by users.

## Directory Structure

The project follows the MVC pattern and is organized into the following directories:

- `models/`: Contains the data models for messages and any interactions with the database.

- `views/`: Contains the HTML templates for rendering the messages and user interface.

- `controllers/`: Manages the application's logic and handles user requests.
